## Summary

The **MemoryWrite** and **MemoryClose** instructions are used to manage a memory account which is owned by the lighthaus program. A memory account can have arbitrary data writen and read from it using the delta assertion. This is useful for storing snapshots of data and making assertions about what was stored in the memory account and compare it to the state of the account at the end of the transaction.

[MemoryWrite](/memory/write) (Write data to a memory account)

<!-- [MemoryClose](/memory/close) (Close a memory account) -->
