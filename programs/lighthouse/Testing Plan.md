    -

- [] Look into memcpy syscall for memory write.
- [] Add multi-write to roadmap
- [x] .info() isnt a good name
- [] Look for more programs to add to KnownPrograms
- [] Use log level helpers
- [] Add additional merkle tree assertions to roadmap
- [] Probably move get_state to its own function not as a variable
- [] Write test plan for validations, multi instructions, utils
- [] Source account for memory write needs to be optional
- [] Add multi write to roadmap
- [] Should I add 128 bit support for account data delta
- [] Probably readd data is empty check
- [] Remove anchor for spl compression
